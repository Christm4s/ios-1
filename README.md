Oh Hey World is a location sharing platform allowing you to share your location with the people who matter. This is a version of an iOS app that is 80% done. We figured we'd let the broader travel community run with it, and create their own branded versions that run on top of Oh Hey World's location sharing platform.
Designs for this app are located here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nmxpd1btcs8uk49/j_FgH-aPjM

What it needs still:
- Upgrade RestKit to latest version (https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit/wiki/Upgrading-from-v0.10.x-to-v0.20.0)
- Finish adding design assets (located here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nmxpd1btcs8uk49/j_FgH-aPjM) or add your own design assets

Possible uses...
- a hotel that wants to create their own branded arrival app
- a tour company wanting to give their customers a seamless arrival experience
- a travel startup who has their own content, that they want to display to users upon arrival or in a search scenario
- a travel startup wanting to capture data for various cities around the globe. for instance, I'd love to see an app that enables people to log wifi speeds for various cities.
- a travel concierge app for private groups (see <a href="http://geekestateblog.com/absurd-idea-real-estate-franchises/">this post</a>)

## Getting Started

1. Visit <a href="http://www.ohheyworld.com">Oh Hey World</a>

## Built With

Oh Hey World is built from the following open source components:

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) - Our back end API is a Rails app. This is the iOS piece that connects to that API.
- That backend API is also open source: https://github.com/oh-hey-world/ohheyworld-platform
